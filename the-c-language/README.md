The C Programming Language – Exercises

This folder contains my personal solutions to exercises from the classic book The C Programming Language by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (commonly referred to as K&R). These exercises cover the fundamentals of C and are widely respected for their focus on core programming skills and problem-solving.
📘 About the Book

    “The C Programming Language” (2nd Edition) is considered the definitive work on C. The exercises included are designed to solidify understanding of syntax, control flow, functions, pointers, data structures, and file I/O.

🗂️ Folder Contents

Each file or group of files corresponds to an exercise or a small set of related exercises.

🎯 Goals

🙌 Contributions

This set of exercises was completed as part of my journey to deeply understand C through the foundational material in K&R. You're welcome to fork and extend the project — especially if you're working through the book too.
