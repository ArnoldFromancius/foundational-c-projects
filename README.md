Foundational C Projects

Welcome to the Foundational C Projects repository! This collection is designed to showcase and reinforce core programming concepts using the C language — from basic syntax to more advanced topics like memory management and data structures.
🚀 Overview

This repository contains a set of foundational C programming projects, each focusing on building skills in:

    Procedural programming

    Pointers and memory

    File I/O

    Data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues)

    Algorithms and problem-solving

These projects are ideal for:

    Beginners learning C

    Students reviewing computer science fundamentals

    Developers revisiting low-level programming

📁 Project Structure

Each subfolder represents a standalone project with its own:

    Source code (.c files)

    Header files (if applicable)

    Makefile (where relevant)

    README (optional per project)

Example structure:

foundational-c-projects/
├── project-1-hello-world/
│   ├── main.c
│   └── README.md
├── project-2-calculator/
│   ├── calculator.c
│   └── ...
...

🧰 Requirements

    GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

    Make (optional, for builds using Makefile)

Install dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential

🔧 How to Use

To compile and run any project:

cd project-folder
gcc -o output_name *.c
./output_name

Or use the Makefile if available:

make
./main
